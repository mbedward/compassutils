This package provides some simple functions for working with map and compass bearings. In particular, it tries to help avoid any confusion between compass angles, where 0 degrees is north and positive angles proceed clockwise, and Cartesian angles where zero is the direction of the positive X-axis and angles proceed anti-clockwise.

**Terrible things will happen when you confuse these two systems!**

To help keep me (and you) safe from such things this package provides functions to convert between compass and Cartesian angles expressed as degrees or radians. There are also handy functions for other map- and compass-related tasks such as finding the bearing from one point to another, and testing whether a bearing lies within a specified angular range.

The package is mainly intended for use by myself and colleagues at the Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfire, University of Wollongong. Everyone is welcome to use it but please treat it as a very early work-in-progress. All code is liable to change without notice in the 0.x versions.


## Installation

You can install the development version of compassutils from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mbedward/compassutils")
```

## Some examples

Convert Cartesian angles in radians to the corresponding compass bearings in degrees.

``` r
library(compassutils)

cartesian_angles <- seq(0, 2*pi, pi/3)

compass_bearings <- cartesian2compass(cartesian_angles, degrees = FALSE) |> rad2deg()
```

Find the compass bearing from a reference point location to each of a set of
other points. The `get_compass_bearing` function can work with point coordinates
provided as simple vectors and matrices, or with point features using the `sf`
package.

``` r
# The reference point
p0 <- c(700000, 6530000)

# A query point to the north-west of p0
p1 <- c(695000, 6535000)

get_compass_bearing(p0, p1)  # returns 315 degrees

# If the two points are the same there is no valid bearing
get_compass_bearing(p0, p0)  # returns NA

```
